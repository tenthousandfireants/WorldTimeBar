World time in Sydney, Berlin, and New York City; on the left side of your taskbar.  Made for windows 11 in mind.  

Made in microsoft VS studio 2022, and python 3.12 with pyinstaller and the included libraries.

Exe should work for the basic program, check source code if you wish to make changes.

Known issue: if it disappears, click on the taskbar it should pop back up.  usually will come back up on it's own.
